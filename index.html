<h2>Popeye The Sailor</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Help Popeye gain his strength by shooting all the spinach cans! 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the players to feel happy and energetic! Players who love Popeye can get a sense of connection with the character as well. 
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This is a shooting/slight aiming game. Movement are also involved using left/right key arrows. 
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Players use left/right key arrows to move Popeye to the desired position. Space is used to shoot and aim the stars at the spinach cans. Points will be redeemed each time a star hit a spinach can. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The game prototype is to test collison of objects and score keeping as well as movement. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Some unique aspects of my game are shooting, movement of targeted objects and aiming. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is set outside of the Yank'Em Stadium. Popeye must use his stars to shoot at the falling spinach cans in order to gain energy. If he doesnt catch some of them before they fall, he looses his chances! His stakes are high as he needs to catch most of them before they fall and accumulate. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Everyone in town is talking about the big fight that will go down between Bluto and Popeye in the Yank'Em Stadium. In order to prepare for this fight, Popeye must collect as much spinach as possible in order to gain his muscles and energy! He is tired of Bluto walking over everyone in the town, so winning this fight would mean alot to the town citizens and especially his lover, Olive Oyl! But first, he must eat all his spinach!! 

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game targets children especially 4 year olds and those who love Popeye :D 
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
My game takes about half a minute or less to play. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Main player strategy is ability to aim and shoot. 
</li>
